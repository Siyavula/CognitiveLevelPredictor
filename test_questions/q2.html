<p><span class="underlined"><strong>Question 4</strong></span> – Work, Energy and Power</p>
<p><span class="underlined"> </span></p>
<p>In an experiment, a 200 g ball is allowed to roll down a curved track (from A) and then up the other side, where it reaches a maximum height at C, as indicated in the diagram below. The slope down (A – B) is smooth and may be considered frictionless, while the slope up (B-C) is rough.</p>
<p><span class="underlined"><strong><img alt="parabola" class="image-inline image-inline" src="pic2.bmp" /></strong></span></p>
<p>Measurements show that A is 100 cm vertically above the bottom of the track and C is      60 cm above the bottom of the track.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>4.1.      Calculate the potential energy of the ball at A, relative to the bottom of the track. (3)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>4.2.      Calculate the energy lost to friction when the ball reaches C.                                             (5)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>4.3.      What has happened to the ‘energy lost to friction’?                                                   (2)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>4.4      If the ball took 0,5 seconds to move from A to B, calculate the rate of work done for this period.                                                                                                                      (3)</p>
